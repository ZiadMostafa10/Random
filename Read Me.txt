- Begin by executing the Visualize.bat script (assuming Anaconda is being used).
- Upon execution, you will be prompted to provide the following inputs:
  1. The name of the Excel file containing the data you wish to visualize.
  2. Select the worksheet from the Excel file that you want to visualize.
  3. Choose the type of chart you want to generate (options include Line Chart, Bar Chart, or Pie Chart).
- The resulting visualization will be stored in the "images" folder.
- Each new execution will generate additional images in the "images" folder and append them as new slides to the presentation.
